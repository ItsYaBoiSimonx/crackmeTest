# ⚒️ CrackMeTest ⚒️

A basic C++ project designed to be cracked easily, following the [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/) style, but open sourced.

## 📜 Description

This project is intentionally created with vulnerabilities and weaknesses to make it easy to crack. It serves as a learning tool to understand basic cracking.

## ⭐ Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your preferred debugger (a suggestion would be [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) but you need to use the bundled x32dbg, since the architecture of cpp .exe files is on 32 bits, not 64).
2. Attempt to crack the project by exploiting the weaknesses and editing the asm code.
3. Document your findings and solutions.

## ⏮️ Prerequisites

To run this project, you just need a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
OR if you're fine with just getting a .exe file to crack, go in the releases tab.
